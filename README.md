# Steganography-App
## What is steganography? 
Steganography is the art of hiding sensitive information within a seemingly benign carrier medium, like a picture, audio file, or text document, without drawing attention from undesired recipients. It entails integrating the concealed data in a way that makes its existence difficult to detect. Usually, the concealed information is encrypted or encoded before being incorporated into the carrier medium by imperceptibly small changes. Making sensitive data look as commonplace and undetectable as feasible is the goal of steganography, which attempts to offer clandestine communication and safeguard its secrecy.
## Description
My project consists of two parts:
<ul>
    <li>
         <ul>
             <li>Steganography involves hiding secret information within different types of media. Text steganography utilizes the Caesar cipher to encrypt a message, allowing users to input a message and a key for encryption. The same key can be used for decryption to reveal the original message.   </li>
        </ul>
        <ul> 
             <li>On the other hand, image steganography refers to the practice of concealing a file within an image. This is achieved by modifying the least significant bits of the pixels in the image. By altering these less noticeable bits, the hidden file can be embedded without easily being detected.li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
</ul>
